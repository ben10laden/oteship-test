    "paragraphs": [
      "OTESHIP was born from a simple yet powerful observation: students with disabilities possess incredible creative potential that often goes untapped in traditional employment pathways. Three special education schools across Europe came together under the Erasmus+ framework to change this narrative.",
      "We recognized that ceramic arts offer more than just a craft—they provide a therapeutic, tactile, and deeply rewarding medium for skill development. By combining hands-on ceramic training with entrepreneurial education, we're creating a bridge between artistic expression and economic independence.",
      "Our vision extends beyond individual success stories. We're building a replicable model that can be adopted by schools and organizations across Europe, proving that inclusive entrepreneurship isn't just possible—it's transformative. Through collaboration, innovation, and unwavering commitment to our students, we're reshaping what's possible for young people with disabilities."
