        "The first workshop focused on the sensory experience of clay. Students explored different textures, temperatures, and consistencies of raw earth materials. This foundational phase allowed participants to communicate through touch, bypassing language barriers.",

        "In the second phase, students worked in mixed-nationality pairs to construct larger vessels using coil and slab techniques. This required negotiation, patience, and shared decision-making, fostering deep interpersonal connections.",

Students shared traditional patterns from their home countries—Polish folk motifs inspired by Łowicz floral designs and paper cut-art (wycinanki), Turkish İznik tile patterns and Ottoman geometric motifs, and Greek geometric designs—combining them into new, hybrid visual narratives.",
